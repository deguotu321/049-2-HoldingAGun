This is an Exiled plugin about comprehensive enhancements for SCP-049-2, with the most eye-catching feature being its ability to allow SCP-049-2 to wield firearms! Engaging in intense shootouts with humans!

Place it in the Plugins folder of Exiled, then restart and enjoy!
It’s that simple—create a more powerful SCP-049-2!

But remember to maintain balance—make sure humans have decent abilities to counter armed SCPs!
